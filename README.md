# -speech-endpoint-detection

It's my Speech Recognition class final project , a speech endpoint detection demo based on python2.7

Project1 includes linear classifier based on short-term energy and short-time zero-crossing rate.

Project2 includes classifier based on 3 GMM(silient, noise, voice). Each GMM has 39 dimensions and is composed of 128 Gaussion model.
